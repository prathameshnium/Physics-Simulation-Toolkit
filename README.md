##  Overview

This toolkit provides a hands-on approach to understanding complex physical systems through computation. Each script or notebook focuses on a specific model, allowing for easy exploration of key parameters and visualization of the results. The primary focus is on magnetic and dielectric phenomena in materials.

Here is a summary of the simulations available in this repository:

| File Name                                 | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `neel_phase_transition_simulation.py`     | Simulates the thermal transition of a 1D antiferromagnetic system (Ising-like model) from an ordered to a paramagnetic state.              |
| `spin_spiral_visualization.py`            | Creates an interactive 3D visualization of a helical magnetic structure (spin spiral), allowing for real-time adjustment of its parameters. |
| `visualize_simple_spin_spiral.py`         | A simplified, static version of the spin spiral visualization, ideal for understanding the basic structure.                               |
| `Ising_new.ipynb` / `ising_lite.ipynb`    | Jupyter notebooks implementing the 2D Ising model to simulate ferromagnetism and the Curie temperature phase transition.                   |
| `Dielectric model.ipynb`                  | A notebook for modeling the dielectric response of materials.                                                                            |
| `Dielectric_power.ipynb`                  | A notebook focused on analyzing power loss or related phenomena in dielectric materials.                                                 |
